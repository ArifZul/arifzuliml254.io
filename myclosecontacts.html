	<p><font face="arial">First of all, the means of close contacts here is referring to my <font color="blue">close family members </font>and all other person that ever <font color="blue">meet and communicate</font> with me, or even hang-out together during our free times. I will <font color="red">not discuss</font> very detail on this topic, since it very personal and not everyone has the same perspective as mine when it comes to close contacts.</font></p>

	<h2>My family members</h2>
	<p><font face="arial">As far as I know, all of my family members including my mother, father, and relatives are all was <font color="blue">given birth at Pahang</font>, so basically we are indigenous to the state. My parents both were born <font color="blue">each in villages</font>, but now each of their family members were immigrate to other villages, which are at the district of <font color="blue">Pekan (my mother)</font> and <font color="blue">Gambang (my father)</font>. However, if I mention about my relatives, it is different story.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial">Other than that, my relatives are basically from Pahang, but it became <font color="red">not true</font> because some of my aunts and aunties were married with outsiders, which are <font color="blue">people outside Pahang</font>. Since then, my family became mixed with my cousins born in half Pahang-Kelantan, or Pahang-Terengganu, or other mix.</font></p>
	<br>
	<h2>My friends</h2>
	<p><font face="arial">As for my friends, of course I have a lot of them. Some of them even still is my best friend until today. From my childhood until became an university student, I was met so many person with many personalities around me, so I can say, I have made friends with many people. Here are how I making friends with others based on different times in my whole life.</font></p>
	<h3>How can I making friends?</h3>
	<font face="arial">These are my ways on making friends and some tips to improve it:-</font><ol type="a">
		<li><b><font face="arial">Childhood time</font></b></li><ul>
			<li>In this era, children are only know how to play, so maybe they will getting closer to other and gather more friends compare to when we grow up. However, I am a passive child back then, so I was scared of anyone</li>
			<li>In this case, it can be solved by the parents encouraging their child to play with others</li>
			</ul> 
		<li><b><font face="arial">Teenage age</font></b></li><ul>
			<li>As teenager, we quite active on certain activities, this is caused by teenage natural feeling to always explore something new in searching on new interest. This is encourage more exposure to other people around them, and easy to making friend with them</li>
			<li>However, downside as being a teenager is they are easier to get expose to many social problems. In this case, this can be solved by keep reminding ourselves, that we need to be a positive person</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b><font face="arial">Adult years</font></b></li><ul>
			<li>I am not at this age yet, but I just want to give opinion about being an adult based on my perspective. In my opiniion, this is the era of busy-working or hard-working. Although, some people are able to work smartly, but others are still struggling.</li>
			<li>In term of making friends, an adult spend less time compare to teenager because they are busy with working</li>
			<li>The best solution is try to balance their working time, so it will decrease the pressure and more time to spend with their friends</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b><font face="arial">Elder age</font></b></li><ul>
			<li>Although, many people get elder illness in this age, some of them are still in healthy condition and be ablr to produce the same energy as they were younger</li>
			<li>As all we know, more illness will occur as we grow older. So, many people will becoming passive. As the solution, we should apply healthy lifestyle even though we still in the young age</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>

	<h2><font face="arial">Summary</font></h2>
	<p><font face="arial">As we arrived at te summary, I would say life is challenging a lot of times, but we need to be strong because good mentality may provide great quality of life. Sometimes, not all peple we can trust because there are many 'toxic friends' nowadays. In this case, our parents can be part of our emotional and mental support to solve the problems.</font></p>
